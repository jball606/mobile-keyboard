#Mobile Device Keyboard

I have given you a functional JAR file you can run it as

```
java -jar keyboard.jar "Your training data here"
```
After you input what you are searching for it will return output that looks like
```"that" (2), "thing" (2), "think" (1), "this" (1), "third" (1), "the" (1), "thoroughly" (1)```

to escape the program just type <b>!q</b> as I followed the vi standard

No special libraries needed, though opinions on java included
